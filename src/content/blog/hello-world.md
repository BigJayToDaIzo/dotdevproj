# Hello, World

If you're reading this, the blog works.

I've been wanting to rebuild my personal site for a while now. The old one was functional but boring - just another generic portfolio template. This time I wanted something that actually reflects my personality.

## Why the terminal aesthetic?

I spend most of my day in a terminal. Helix, Zellij, SSH sessions, git operations, build scripts. The terminal is where real work happens.

Plus, there's something satisfying about the aesthetic. Monospace fonts, syntax highlighting colors, the blinking cursor. It's nostalgic and modern at the same time.

## What's next?

I'm planning to write about:

- **Technical tutorials** - Things I've figured out that might save someone else time
- **Project writeups** - Deep dives into things I've built
- **Random thoughts** - Career stuff, industry observations, whatever

No promises on a schedule. I'll write when I have something worth saying.

## The stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), which has been a pleasure to work with. Static site generation, content collections for the blog, and zero JavaScript shipped to the client by default (unless I specifically opt in).

The terminal styling is pure CSS - no canvas shenanigans or heavy JavaScript libraries.

Thanks for stopping by. More to come.
